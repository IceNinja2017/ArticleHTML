                <p>The global pandemic has continued to stretch on, and for most of us, especially in the country, the end still seems out of reach. If you’re one of those who have turned to art to cope, here’s a bit of good news. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) has once again put together the Tingin ASEAN Film Festival, which showcases short films from all over the Southeast Asian region. The best part is that you can watch all these films for free.</p>
                <p>Running from Sept. 24 to 26, the film festival will be hosted on the NCCA National Committee on Cinema’s Vimeo channel. And with the theme “Remedies for Dis-ease,” the festival’s chosen films may serve as that needed escape or inspiration for this period of restlessness and hopelessness.</p>
